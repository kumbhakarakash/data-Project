#simple project using c++ file I/O machanism
This project is about on learningg how we will read data from file(generaly in .CSV format) and process those data based on our requirment.
It is about data streamimng from .CSV file that is stored in harddisk(secondary memory) in my computer and read those data, bring them into main memory,store them in data construct like vector,metrices etc.
After getting those data from the file into the vectors or metrices ,we now can process those based on our requirement.

So this is a tiny work which is showcasing data streaming from file to main memory using c++ language.
